# GWAAS: Leif GW As A Service
An API written in Go using Fiber to provide Leif GW noises on demand.


## Endpoints
- `/api/v1/grunt` returns a random Leif GW grunt.
- `/api/v1/aaa` returns a random aaa, similar to the grunt but one can hear the letter A in it.
- `/api/v1/skumbanan` Leif GW talks about how he ate a skumbanan.


## Live demo
A live demo is available over at [gwaas.hackerti.me](https://gwaas.hackerti.me).
